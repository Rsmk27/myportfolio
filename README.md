an enthusiastic Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student with a passion for combining traditional electrical engineering with emerging technologies such as IoT, Smart Energy, and Artificial Intelligence.

I believe engineering is not just about theory but about building real-world solutions. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in Green Technology, Smart Energy Systems, and Autonomous Grids, aiming to create sustainable innovations that shape the future of energy. Alongside my core engineering studies, I actively explore software development, embedded systems, and web technologies, bridging the gap between hardware and software.
